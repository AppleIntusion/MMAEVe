My first attempt at building the programs was shit. It did work
but the organization was atrocious and was not particularly
extensible. This version is much better. However, it is still
absolutely shit. I use inheritence rather than composition. In
a few of the cases I think it is wholly appropriate. The class
structures for the differenc objects need to be dramatically
simplified. Looking at them makes me want to tear my goddamn
eyes out. A few long term goals are listed below:
    
    1) Attempt to use NumBa to increase performance. Maybe even
       to get the old girl running on a GPU.
    2) Switch the pairwise distance search to one using a scipy
       spatial KDTree.
    3) Finish the lipid nanodisc.
    4) Switch to a numerically stable method for determining the
       angle between two vectors.
