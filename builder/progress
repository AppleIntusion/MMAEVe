You have functions to import the atoms of a pdb file. You are working on
generating a molecule class that can easily have class methods like transformation
and rotation performed on it.

A good point to pick up at would be making a funtion in the manipulate_pdb.py module
that creates a Molecule() class object using the information imported from a
PDB file.
